    <h1>Our Story</h1>
    <p>Talent Match Africa was born out of an earlier incarnation: InternMatch, founded by Gerard Holland, now the co-founder of TMA.</p>
    <div class="quote-highlight">
      Talent is equally distributed, opportunity is not.
    </div>
    <p>This powerful truth resonates deeply with us. It captures both the untapped potential of skilled African professionals waiting to be discovered globally and the transformative impact they can have on businesses worldwide seeking to scale and thrive.</p>

          <h3>The Beginning</h3>
          <p>Our founder, Gerard Holland, witnessed the employment struggles of international students in Australia. To address this challenge, he established InternMatch, collaborating with universities and education partners to place Australian graduates into valuable internships.</p>

        <div class="timeline-content">
          <h3>Pivotal Conversation</h3>
          <p>A significant opportunity emerged through a conversation with Zondwa Mandela. This dialogue shifted Gerard's focus to Africa, raising a compelling question: Why was South Africa home to five universities ranked in the world's top 1% so overlooked as a source of exceptional talent?</p>

          <h3>African Expansion</h3>
          <p>Post-pandemic, Gerard made his first visit to Africa and launched The Global Employment Challenge in South Africa. The mission was clear: create sustainable job opportunities for the abundance of African talent.</p>

          <h3>Talent Match Africa</h3>
          <p>With insufficient local opportunities for graduates from prestigious universities, and traditional offshore sourcing models needing innovation, we developed a forward thinking approach to international recruitment. The global shift towards remote work became our catalyst to introduce African talent into global workflows.</p>
